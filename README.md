# TIC-TAC-TOE
This tic-tac-toe game runs in terminal. The game has a player vs player mode and a ***player vs computer mode***.

<ins>The computer vs player has three different difficulty modes</ins>; EASY, MODERATE & **DIFFICULT** (the main focus).

## BRIEF WORKING
In EASY mode, the COMPUTER places the marking randomly;  
In DIFFICULT mode, the COMPUTER has few predefined moves, followed by the core algorithm(developed by me) which helps it for decision making. Thus making it impossible to defeat.  
In MEDIUM mode, there exists the core algorithm, but there are no predefined moves, making the game random amd playful for the player
