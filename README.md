# TIC-TAC-TOE
This tic-tac-toe game runs in terminal. The game has a player vs player mode and a ***player vs computer mode***.

<ins>The computer vs player has three different difficulty modes</ins>: EASY, MODERATE & **DIFFICULT** (the main focus).


## BRIEF WORKING
- In EASY mode, the COMPUTER places the marking randomly  

- <ins>**In DIFFICULT mode**, the COMPUTER has few predefined moves, followed by the core algorithm which helps it for decision making. Thus making it impossible to defeat.<ins>  

- In MODERATE mode, the core algorithm, makes decision without any predefined moves, making the game random and playful.


### Snippet from a match  <img width="955" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-16 at 5 52 58â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f48883af-614c-479f-9876-13906ae0e5b9" />


**NOTE:** If you run this code in windows do replace:   system("clear");   command with:   system("cls");  
 (this is used to clear the terminal)


  
  Have fun playing the game and exploring the algorithm.
