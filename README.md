# TIC-TAC-TOE
This tic-tac-toe game runs in terminal. The game has a player vs player mode and a ***player vs computer mode***.

<ins>The computer vs player has three different difficulty modes</ins>: EASY, MODERATE & **DIFFICULT** (the main focus).


## BRIEF WORKING
- In EASY mode, the COMPUTER places the marking randomly  

- <ins>**In DIFFICULT mode**, the COMPUTER has few predefined moves, followed by the core algorithm(developed by me) which helps it for decision making. Thus making it impossible to defeat<ins>  

- In MODERATE mode, there exists the core algorithm, but there are no predefined moves, making the game random and playful
